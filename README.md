# Grape-Tiled-Amplicon-Scheme
Tiled targeted amplicon scheme is a primer scheme for simultaneous detection of 11 grapevine viruses:
The targeted grapevine viruses are litsted as follow.
1. Grapevine Leafroll aaaociated Virus 1 (GLRaV-1)
2. Grapevine Leafroll aaaociated Virus 2 (GLRaV-2)
3. Grapevine Leafroll aaaociated Virus 3 (GLRaV-3)
4. Grapevine Leafroll associated Virus 4 (GLRaV-4)
5. Grapevine Leafroll associated Virus 4 strain 5 (GLRaV-4 strain -5)
6. Grapevine Leafroll associated Virus 4 strain 5 (GLRaV-4 strain -9)
7. Grapevine Virus A (GVA)
8. Grapevine Pinot Gris Virus (GPGV)
9. Grapevine Virus B (GVB)
10. Grapevine Fleck Virus (GFkV)
11. Grapevine Rupestris Stem Pitting assocciated Virus (GRSPaV)

This primer scheme is to used with the ** targted amplicon sequencing for simultaneous detection of eleven grapevine viruses assay ** link..

## Data analysis (how to use the primer scheme) 
We recomened using the InterArtic wrapper created by Ferguson et al 2022 and our primer scheme. Alternatvely one can map raw reads directly to the reference provided in our customised primer scheme. 

### Using the InterArtic wrappper. 
The InterArtic uses bioinformatics resources from the ARTIC Network and was originally created to analyse CoV-2 but it is also ** suitable for analysis of amplicon scheme like the ones presented here (link)
